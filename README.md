# README

This backend for the National Park Tracker app allows you to maintain and host the required data. Note: because the nps.gov API was very slow and difficult to work with this backend doubles as a scraper for the NPS API.

## Installation

execute:

    $ bundle install
    $ rails db:migrate
    $ rails db:seed

and launch the local host server with

    $ rails s
